Algorithm to find whether a number is Composite or Prime

Step 1: Start.
Step 2: Accept a Positive Integer 'n' greater than 2 
Step 3: Intialize counter variable "i" with value 2.
Step 4: Divide the number 'n' with counter variable "i".
Step 5: If the remainder is zero ,display that the positive number is Composite.
Step 6: If the remainder is not zero ,else increment for i will be countered and repeat from Step 4 ,untill the counter variable value is 1 less the number accepted - (n -1).
Step 7: After completion of all the steps display that number 'n' is Prime.
Step 8: Stop.
